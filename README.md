## üìò Project Overview
This repository presents a **comprehensive exploratory analysis** of *Supermarket Branch Sales* data using a structured, research-based PPDAC approach.  
The objective is to uncover store-level performance insights, analyze operational metrics, and visualize relationships between customer traffic, store area, and total sales.

The analysis is fully reproducible, automated, and generates both visual outputs and a Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration.

## üéØ Research Framework (PPDAC)

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Problem** | How do store characteristics (area, inventory, customer count) influence total sales? |
| **Plan** | Design a Python-based ETL ‚Üí KPI computation ‚Üí visualization pipeline to uncover store performance insights. |
| **Data** | Raw CSV dataset (`Stores.csv`) containing branch-level metrics such as area, items available, daily customer count, and sales. |
| **Analysis** | Perform statistical cleaning, compute sales KPIs, and visualize trends (distribution, regression, correlation). |
| **Conclusion** | Identify key drivers of sales performance, top-performing branches, and operational optimization insights. |

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools Used |
|-----------|-------------|
| Programming | Python 3.x |
| Libraries | pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, nbformat |
| Visualization | Seaborn & Matplotlib |
| Automation | os, glob, nbconvert |
| Output | PNG charts + auto-generated Jupyter notebook |

## üìä Analytical Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Extraction & Cleaning
- Automatically detects and loads `Stores.csv` (robust encoding support).
- Cleans numeric columns (`Store_Area`, `Items_Available`, `DailyCustomerCount`, `Store_Sales`).
- Handles missing values and invalid entries gracefully.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ KPI Generation
- **Sales per Customer** = Store_Sales √∑ DailyCustomerCount  
- **Sales per Area** = Store_Sales √∑ Store_Area  

These KPIs quantify operational efficiency and customer impact on revenue.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Visual Analysis
The script automatically generates and saves high-quality PNG charts:

| Visualization | Insight |
|----------------|----------|
| **Sales Distribution** | Identifies spread and skewness of store sales |
| **Top 10 Stores by Sales** | Highlights leading performers |
| **Store Area vs. Sales** | Evaluates how floor space impacts revenue |
| **Customer Count vs. Sales** | Correlates foot traffic with performance |
| **Pairplot** | Explores relationships across multiple KPIs |
| **Correlation Matrix** | Quantifies strength and direction of relationships |

Each chart is saved into `/stores_assets/` and embedded in the generated Jupyter notebook.

## üßÆ Conclusion (PPDAC)

| Aspect | Key Insight |
|--------|--------------|
| **Problem** | Variability in store sales suggests strong dependencies on internal factors (area, inventory, customers). |
| **Plan** | Analyze these relationships statistically and visually to identify actionable levers. |
| **Data** | Dataset of store branches with metrics on space, inventory, and traffic. |
| **Analysis** | Found strong correlations between customer count and sales, and moderate influence from store area. |
| **Conclusion** | Stores with balanced space utilization and customer engagement achieve the highest sales per area. |
